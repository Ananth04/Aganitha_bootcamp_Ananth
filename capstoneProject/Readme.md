# Responsive Web Application with functionality

This project demonstrates a responsive web application. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic navigation experience.



## Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `html`: Contains the web-content for the application.
- `css`: Includes the CSS styles for the pages.
- `js`: Contains the JavaScript codes to enhance functionality in the application.

## How It Works

- The navigation bar is designed to be responsive, showing a hamburger menu on screens smaller than 768 pixels.
- Clicking the hamburger icon toggles the visibility of the navigation links.
- The design emphasizes flexibility and ease of integration into existing projects.

## Customize

- Modify the colors, sizes, or additional styles in the CSS to match your project's design.
- Add more navigation links or adjust the layout as needed in the HTML structure.
