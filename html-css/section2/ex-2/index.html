    <h1>Character Encoding Types</h1>
    <p>Character encoding is a crucial aspect of web development that defines how characters and symbols are represented digitally. There are various types of character encodings, and the choice of encoding depends on the specific needs of a website or application:</p>

    <h2>UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format 8-bit)</h2>
    <p>UTF-8 is the most widely used character encoding on the internet. It can represent characters from virtually all writing systems, making it ideal for multilingual websites. UTF-8 is flexible, efficient, and backward compatible with ASCII.</p>

    <h2>ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1)</h2>
    <p>ISO-8859-1 is a character encoding primarily for Western European languages. It's a single-byte encoding, which means it can represent characters from languages like English, French, and Spanish but not characters from other writing systems.</p>

    <h2>ISO-8859-5 (Cyrillic)</h2>
    <p>ISO-8859-5 is designed for the Cyrillic script used in languages such as Russian, Bulgarian, and Serbian. It's suitable for websites focused on these languages.</p>

    <h2>ISO-8859-8 (Hebrew)</h2>
    <p>ISO-8859-8 is intended for the Hebrew script and is used in websites that display content in Hebrew or related languages.</p>

    <h2>Shift JIS</h2>
    <p>Shift JIS is a character encoding commonly used for the Japanese language. It's efficient for Japanese text but not suitable for other languages.</p>

    <h2>GBK (Guóbiāo Kùnghé Zì) - Chinese</h2>
    <p>GBK is designed for simplified Chinese characters and is commonly used for websites in mainland China.</p>

    <h2>JSesh Encoding</h2>
    <p>JSesh is specifically designed for Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs</p>

    <p>Choosing the right character encoding is essential to ensure that text and symbols are displayed accurately on your website and that it can cater to the linguistic diversity of your audience.</p>
