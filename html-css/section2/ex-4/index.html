    <p><u>Viewport Metadata:</u>The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page.
        The viewport varies with the device, and will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.<br><br> The viewport meta tag makes a website responsive. The viewport meta tag is not directly related to SEO but is essential for ensuring that the website is mobile-friendly. A mobile-responsive design is increasingly important because search engines consider mobile-friendliness as a ranking factor.</p>
