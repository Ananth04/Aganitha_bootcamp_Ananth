        <h1>The OSI Model</h1>
        <p>The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven distinct layers. These layers facilitate communication between different systems and devices by breaking down the communication process into manageable parts.</p>

        <h2>Layer 7: Application Layer</h2>
        <p>The Application Layer is the topmost layer and is closest to the end user. It deals with the user interface, data exchange, and network services used by applications.</p>

        <h2>Layer 6: Presentation Layer</h2>
        <p>The Presentation Layer focuses on data translation, encryption, and compression. It ensures that data sent from the Application Layer of one system can be read by the Application Layer of another system.</p>

        <h2>Layer 5: Session Layer</h2>
        <p>The Session Layer establishes, manages, and terminates sessions or connections between applications. It also handles synchronization and checkpointing.</p>

        <h2>Layer 4: Transport Layer</h2>
        <p>The Transport Layer is responsible for end-to-end communication and error recovery. It manages data segmentation, flow control, and error checking.</p>

        <h2>Layer 3: Network Layer</h2>
        <p>The Network Layer is responsible for addressing and routing data between devices on different networks. It deals with logical addressing and routing tables.</p>

        <h2>Layer 2: Data Link Layer</h2>
        <p>The Data Link Layer deals with data framing and error detection. It is divided into two sublayers: Logical Link Control (LLC) and Media Access Control (MAC).</p>

        <h2>Layer 1: Physical Layer</h2>
        <p>The Physical Layer is the lowest layer and deals with the physical medium, such as cables, connectors, and signaling. It defines the hardware characteristics for data transmission.</p>
