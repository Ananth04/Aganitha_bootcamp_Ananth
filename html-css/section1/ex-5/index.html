    <p>The SEO benefits from the metadata used are:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><u>Title Metadata:</u> The title tag, "Art Haven: Discover a World of Masterpieces," serves as a concise and enticing description of the website. It includes the website's name and a compelling call to action, which can attract users searching for art-related content. A well-optimized title tag can improve click-through rates from search engine results.</li>
        <li><u>Description Metadata:</u> The meta description, "Welcome to Art Haven, your gateway to a diverse and captivating collection of art...," provides a succinct yet informative overview of the site's content. It not only helps search engines understand the site's focus but also engages users with a promise of a diverse and captivating art collection</li>
        <li><u>Keywords Metadata:</u> While the use of the "keywords" meta tag has diminished in importance for SEO, it can still have a minor impact. In this case, the keywords "Art," "paintings," and "sculptures" are relevant to the website's content.</li>
        <li><u>Viewport Metadata:</u> The viewport meta tag is not directly related to SEO but is essential for ensuring that the website is mobile-friendly. A mobile-responsive design is increasingly important because search engines consider mobile-friendliness as a ranking factor.</li>
        <li><u>Encoding:</u> While this doesn't directly affect SEO, it is an essential technical aspect for ensuring that your content displays properly.</li>
