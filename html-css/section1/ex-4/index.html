    <!-- Your task: Write a paragraph explaining your choice of custom charset and how it impacts the rendering of historical scripts on the website. -->
    <p>This choice of custom charset(JSesh) is to ensure proper display of egyptian hieroglyphs. Even UTF-8 encoding has these hieroglyphs included.
        <br>
        I have chosen the egyptian hieroglyphs because of my interest in Ubisoft video games.</p>
    <h1>Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphs</h1>
    <p>Here are some of the examples of Egyptian hieroglyphs, their meanings, and Unicode encoding values:</p>
    <div class="hieroglyphs">
        <p><span class="hieroglyph">𓂋</span> - <span class="meaning">Sun</span> (UTF-8: U+1308B, JSesh encoding)</p>
        <p><span class="hieroglyph">𓁣</span> - <span class="meaning">Pharaoh</span> (UTF-8: U+131A3, JSesh encoding)</p>
        <p><span class="hieroglyph">𓂢</span> - <span class="meaning">Ankh (Life)</span> (UTF-8: U+130A2, JSesh encoding)</p>
        <p><span class="hieroglyph">𓈖</span> - <span class="meaning">Snake</span> (UTF-8: U+13216, JSesh encoding)</p>
